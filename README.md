# Legend-of-Zelda-Location-Tracker

This z1 tracker is designed for the open 
source z1 randomizer found at http://z1r.tetra.ly



Current functionality is very basic.  Each map tab has a grid corresponding 
to the screens
seen in gameplay.  Clicking on one piece of the grid, will toggle 
it's marker type.  
Currently there are only two marker types.  Possibly adding 
more in the future.

To the right of the Lv 9 button, is a color picker, to change 
the background color.
If you're using an addon to alter the css, it may have minor
conflicts with this color picker.

Rooms with a staircase to an item is considered to have a drop.
Level 3's room with the item staircase also has a drop.  Indicated on map with "2x".

Have suggestions?  Please feel free to post them on the github page at:
