# Legend-of-Zelda-Location-Tracker

This z1 tracker is designed for the open source z1 randomizer found at http://z1r.tetra.ly/

Current functionality is very basic.  Each map tab has a grid corresponding to the screens
seen in gameplay.  Clicking on one piece of the grid, will toggle it's marker type.  
Currently there are only two marker types.  Possibly adding m,ore in the future.

To the right of the Lv 9 button, is a color picker, to change the background color.
If you're using an addon to alter the css, it may have minor conflicts with this color picker.

Thanks to:
- Tetraly (creating the open source z1 rando)
